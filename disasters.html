            <h3>Floods</h3>
            <p>Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing widespread damage to property, infrastructure, and lives. They result from excessive rainfall, storm surges, or dam failures, leading to overflowing rivers and submerged lands. In addition to physical destruction, floods often lead to waterborne diseases, displacement of communities, and economic losses. Implementing early warning systems, effective drainage planning, and flood-resistant infrastructure can significantly reduce their impact.</p>

            <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
            <p>Earthquakes strike without warning, shaking the ground violently and causing buildings to collapse. They result from the movement of tectonic plates along fault lines and can trigger landslides and tsunamis. The destruction of homes, roads, and vital infrastructure makes rescue operations challenging. Preparedness measures such as earthquake-resistant structures, emergency response plans, and public awareness campaigns can save countless lives and minimize destruction.</p>

            <h3>Hurricanes</h3>
            <p>Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are powerful storms that form over warm ocean waters. They bring strong winds, heavy rain, and massive storm surges, leading to widespread destruction. Coastal areas are most vulnerable, with flooding, infrastructure damage, and loss of life being common consequences. Advanced forecasting and early warning systems help communities prepare and minimize impact.</p>

            <h3>Wildfires</h3>
            <p>Wildfires spread rapidly through dry vegetation, consuming forests, homes, and wildlife habitats. They are often caused by lightning, human activity, or extreme heat and drought conditions. The loss of biodiversity, air pollution, and destruction of property are major concerns. Fire prevention strategies, controlled burns, and community awareness play crucial roles in mitigating wildfire risks.</p>
